# STAT333_Project
This is the project repo for the course STAT333 I am taking, taught by Prof. Kevin Packard, at UW-Madison. 

The project is about predicting pm, using the data retrieved from here: http://www.openair-project.org/


I am going to sync my code to here irregularly, just to keep things a little more organized...
